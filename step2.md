### STEP 2 - Build your form

- In `Form.js` build out your markup

- Build inputs for `name`, `email` and `role` (backend engineer, frontend engineer, designer, etc. Use your imagination)

- Import the useState hook and utilize what we learned about two-way data binding

- Render your `Form` component in `App` and pass a setter method (the `set_____` method from your team members state in `App`) down to it so you can add team members to your state.
